# Web_Development_Bootcamp
My projects in the Web Development Bootcamp Udemy course.


## [My CV](https://arielmaj.github.io/Web_Development_Bootcamp/CV/index.html)

Here you can find my [CV website](https://arielmaj.github.io/Web_Development_Bootcamp/CV/index.html). Currently two pages fully on HTML and CSS (no Bootstrap yet).

I may add new pages with boostrap in the future and I'm certainly including JS eventually.

## Smaller Challenges Folder

This folder is just small html/css code the teacher asks to write throughout the course for training some of the things taught.

## JS Basics Folder

The course teaches the basics of JS before applying it in websites. This is where those are going.
