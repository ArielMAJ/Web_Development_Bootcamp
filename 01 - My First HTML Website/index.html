  <h1>Ariel M. A. J.</h1>
  <p><em>Student and developer.</em></p>
  <p>I'm currently studying many programming languages
    and tools for building a nice portfolio.
    Even though what I like to study the most is <a href="https://github.com/ArielMAJ/100-days-of-code">Python3</a>,
    Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence,
    I'm doing my best to grow my knowledge in those
    subjects without being limited to only them.
    Thus, I'm also learning: <a href="https://github.com/ArielMAJ/CSharp_course">C#</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/ArielMAJ/CSharp_WF_Projects">Windows Forms</a> and SQL for building
    <a href="https://github.com/ArielMAJ/WF_VD_Project">Windows Apps</a>;
    <a href="https://github.com/ArielMAJ/Web_Development_Bootcamp">JS/HTML/CSS for Web development</a>; and a few other things for some
    "smaller" projects mainly involving Python (but other languages/tools as well).
